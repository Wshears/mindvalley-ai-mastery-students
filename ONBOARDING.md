# Onboarding Guide

> Complete these steps to arrive at class ready to build.
> **Estimated time:** 42 minutes

---

## Before You Start

- [ ] Complete the [Pre-Class Checklist](SETUP.md) first
- [ ] Have your API keys and passwords ready
- [ ] Set aside 45 uninterrupted minutes

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repo (2 min)

Open your terminal (Mac: Terminal app, Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8Dvibes/mindvalley-ai-mastery-students.git
cd mindvalley-ai-mastery-students
```

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
ls -la
```

You should see:
```
SETUP.md
ONBOARDING.md
setup.sh
docs/
workflows/
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- `git: command not found` → Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- `Repository not found` → Check the URL, or ask in Slack for access

---

## Step 2: Run Setup Script (1 min)

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
========================================
  MindValley AI Mastery - Setup Check
========================================

Checking directory structure...
   ✓ docs/ exists
   ✓ workflows/ exists

Checking required files...
   ✓ SETUP.md
   ✓ ONBOARDING.md

✅ Setup verified! You're ready for Step 3.
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- `Permission denied` → Run `chmod +x setup.sh` first
- Missing directories → Re-run `git clone` command from Step 1

---

## Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop (5 min)

> Skip this step if you're using ChatGPT Plus instead of Claude Pro.

### 3.1 Open Claude Desktop
- Launch the Claude Desktop app (not the web browser version)
- If not installed, download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

### 3.2 Add Project Instructions
1. Click the **folder icon** in the bottom-left (or go to Settings → Projects)
2. Create a new project called "AI Mastery"
3. Click "Add custom instructions"
4. Copy the contents of `docs/claude-desktop-instructions.txt` and paste

### 3.3 Verify Setup
- You should see "AI Mastery" in your projects sidebar
- Claude now understands your course context

**Troubleshooting:**
- Can't find Projects? → Update Claude Desktop to the latest version
- Instructions too long? → Paste in sections, starting with the "Core Context" section

---

## Step 4: Configure Claude Code (5 min)

### 4.1 Open VS Code
1. Launch VS Code
2. File → Open Folder → select `mindvalley-ai-mastery-students`

### 4.2 Verify Claude Code Extension
1. Look for the Claude Code icon in the left sidebar (speech bubble icon)
2. Click it to open the Claude Code panel
3. Sign in if prompted

### 4.3 Test Claude Code
In the Claude Code input box, type:
```
/help
```

**Expected:** You should see a help menu with available commands.

**Troubleshooting:**
- No Claude icon? → Go to Extensions, search "Claude Code", install
- Sign in failed? → Verify Claude Pro subscription is active at claude.ai
- Extension not responding? → Restart VS Code

---

## Step 5: Test Bridge Round-Trip (15 min)

The "bridge" is how you'll work throughout this course: You orchestrate (decide what to build), AI executes (writes the code and configs).

### 5.1 Read the Sample Task
Open `docs/sample-task-spec.md` in VS Code.

This is a task specification - the format you'll use to give AI clear instructions.

### 5.2 Execute with Claude Code
1. Open Claude Code panel (click the icon)
2. Paste this prompt:

```
Read the task spec at docs/sample-task-spec.md and execute it.
Write the results to docs/faq-draft.md
```

3. Let Claude Code work. It will:
   - Read the task spec
   - Research your company's FAQs (or create examples)
   - Write the output file

### 5.3 Verify Results
1. Check that `docs/faq-draft.md` was created
2. Review the content
3. This is the workflow you'll use throughout the course!

**Expected time:** 10-15 minutes (Claude does the work)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Claude Code doesn't respond? → Restart VS Code
- "Permission denied" errors? → Check file permissions in the folder
- Results file not created? → Ask Claude Code "What went wrong?"

---

## Step 6: Verify N8N Connection (10 min)

### 6.1 Log into N8N Cloud
1. Go to your N8N instance URL (e.g., `https://your-name.app.n8n.cloud`)
2. Log in with your credentials

### 6.2 Import Test Workflow
1. Click **Add workflow** (or the + button)
2. Click the menu (···) → **Import from file**
3. Select `workflows/00-test-connection.json` from your cloned repo

### 6.3 Run the Workflow
1. Click the red **Execute workflow** button at the **bottom center** of the canvas
2. The workflow runs immediately (it's a manual trigger)
3. You'll see green checkmarks appear on each node when complete

### 6.4 View the Results
1. Click the **Executions** tab at the top center of the screen
2. Click on the execution row that just appeared (shows timestamp)
3. Click on the **"Create Success Message"** node to see its output

### 6.5 Verify Success
**Expected output** (shown in the OUTPUT panel on the right):
```json
{
  "message": "Hello from N8N!",
  "status": "connected",
  "workflow": "Test Connection Successful"
}
```

You should see these three fields in a table or JSON view.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Import fails? → Check N8N plan (Starter tier required)
- Workflow errors? → Screenshot the error, ask in Slack
- "Node not found"? → You may need to install community nodes (Settings → Community Nodes)

## Step 7: Verify Gemini Setup (5 min)

### 7.1 Get Your API Key
1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Click **Get API Key** in the left sidebar
3. Create a new key (or copy existing)

### 7.2 Test the API
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Say hello in exactly 3 words"}]}]}'
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

> **Note:** If the model name changes, try `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` or check [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) for the current model name.

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "candidates": [{
    "content": {
      "parts": [{"text": "Hello to you!"}]
    }
  }]
}
```

### 7.3 Save Your Key
Store your API key somewhere secure:
- Password manager (recommended)
- Encrypted notes app
- `.env` file (we'll set this up in class)

**NEVER commit API keys to Git!**

**Troubleshooting:**
- `400 Bad Request` → Check for extra spaces in the API key
- `403 Forbidden` → Verify key is from aistudio.google.com
- `curl: command not found` → Install curl or use an API testing tool like Postman
